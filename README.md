# MightyMover
Senior Design Project of an autonomous auto-following wagon.
#The Problem
Everyone has trouble carrying objects.  ​

​
What solutions are there for the physically challenged?​


Even wagons need to be pushed and pulled which causes strain on the body.​
#The Solution​
A product that will get the user's items to and from without interacting with the cart.​

​
​The MightyMover system is a two-component system. It includes the user’s phone and the mover. ​

The user’s phone will have an app compatible with the MightyMover. The user will send instructions and get feedback over a Bluetooth connection. ​

The Raspberry Pi will process the Bluetooth communication, object detection code, and PWM output (for the motors). ​

The MightyMover includes subsystems such as: ​

Phone-to-MightyMover Communications ​

MightyMover Motor Control System ​

Image recognition for obstacle avoidance

Software Hub Design and Battery Management.  ​
